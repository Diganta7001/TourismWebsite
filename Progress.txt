This text file will keep the inner details of this project for me.

uptill now we have created the delete route and now we will be creating the boiler plate code
    1. we have installed ejs-mate by running npm i ejs-mate.
    2. we have created a layout folder in which we will be storing the layout and it is boilerplate.ejs
    3. inside boilerplate.ejs we have written
         <div>  <%- body -%> </div>
        to require the body then we call this boilerplate.ejs from other eg. index.ejs file 
        first remove head part of index.ejs then do <% layout('./layouts/boilerplate.ejs') -%>
    4. also in app.js do this 
        const ejsMate = require("ejs-mate")
        app.engine('ejs', ejsMate);

    5. to run the static files like css or javascript we make a new folder call 'public' 
        and in app.js do this
            app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,"/public")))
